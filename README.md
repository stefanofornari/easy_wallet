A simple Crypto wallets app to easily manage and create personal wallets.

NOTE: at the moment you must use the master channel, otherwise some flutter tests do not work (see https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/98965).

20220620 - I am putting this project on hold due to [this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72677536/flutter-update-the-ui-with-value-from-an-async-function). I started the project as a way to learn Dart and Flutter. Dart is an interesting language with many shortcuts, but the async by default approach makes it mode difficult than it should be. Flutter IMHO is a pain, really! It is totally non sense and a huge jump back in the past in UI development. Everything (model, controller, view) mixed up in code and a really combersome way of updating the UI... plus, do not go too fast or it simply won't update...
